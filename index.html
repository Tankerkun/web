<h2>Html이란 무엇인가?</h2>
<a href="https://www.naver.com" target="_blank" title="네이버"> <strong>Hypertext markup language (html)</strong></a> is the standard Markup language for
<strong>creating <u><a href="http://www.nate.com" target="_blank" title="네이트">web</a></u> pages</strong> and web applications.

<h2>Transforming Transportation</h2>
<p style="margin-top:10px;">Shared data associated with transportation has great potential for improving the passenger experience, with opportunities to offer enhanced information, entertainment, efficiency, maintenance, safety, and convenience.
</p>
<p>
Several technology trends are driving a significant increase in the ability to generate and share a wide range of relevant information. <br>Parallel advances in sensors, communications, cloud and data analytics infrastructure, geophysical mapping, machine learning, mobile devices, user interfaces and related areas have created a rich foundation that can offer tremendous opportunity for creating value.
</p>
<p>
This potential is hindered presently from lack of interoperability.<br> The transportation ecosystem can benefit by building a Web of Data to unleash this potential.
</p>
<p>
As the first W3C initiative in this space, the Automotive Working Group is designed to address the need for standards in a connected vehicle ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
By specifying common data models and incorporating existing and emerging Web standards, we can accelerate the market for next generation applications. <br> The scope might reside solely within or across vehicles, or extend across other modes of transportation and related services.

<h3>The Changing Landscape</h3>
The automotive industry is transforming towards an environment that depends heavily on the data that underlies the essential performance and driving experience of a vehicle.
</p>
<p>
Automobiles are increasingly becoming sources of rich information for in-vehicle, cross-vehicle and cloud based applications that will improve performance, safety, efficiency, and entertainment.<br> These applications may be designed for individual vehicles or address a wide range of them. They may also be part of a broader ecosystem that, for example, might incorporate other transportation modes, address general public safety issues and SmartCity (v2i) interactions.
